📊 Unemployment Analysis with Python
🧠 Overview

This project analyzes unemployment rate data across different regions of India to understand trends, regional variations, and the impact of COVID-19. Using Python, the data is cleaned, explored, and visualized to uncover patterns that can inform economic and social policy decisions.

An interactive Streamlit dashboard is also created to visualize the findings dynamically.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze unemployment rate data representing unemployed people as a percentage.

Clean and preprocess the dataset for accuracy.

Explore unemployment trends using Python visualizations.

Investigate the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates.

Identify seasonal or regional patterns in unemployment.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Static visualizations for EDA
